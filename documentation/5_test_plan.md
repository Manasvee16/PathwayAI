# Test Plan

## 1. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing:** Test individual functions/components (e.g., resume builder logic)
- **Integration Testing:** Test interactions between modules (e.g., API + UI)
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Simulate user flows (e.g., onboarding to resume download)

## 2. Test Cases (Examples)
- User registration/login
- Onboarding form validation
- Resume generation and ATS scoring
- Cover letter creation/editing
- Interview question feedback
- Dashboard analytics display

## 3. Tools
- **Jest** for unit/integration tests
- **Playwright/Cypress** for E2E tests

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- All critical user flows work as expected
- No major bugs in production
- Meets all functional requirements

## 5. Agile Testing Practices
- Write tests for each user story
- Continuous integration (CI) for automated test runs
- Regular bug triage and backlog grooming
